About me
------
I am Wanting Wei, a thrid year Biophtsics PhD candidate at the Univeristy of Wisocnisn-Madison! I am currently adviced by [Thomas Friedrich](https://friedrichlab.vetmed.wisc.edu/)
 My research focus on how viruses evolve within individual hosts, particaly on SARS-CoV-2 prolonged infection.

Why we studied SARS-CoV-2 prolonged infection? <br>
In typical chains of acute SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the virus is subject to frequent stringent genetic bottlenecks, making it difficult for adaptive mutations to rise to high frequency and spread in the population. In contrast, persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections allow the virus to replicate over an extended period and may release SARS-CoV-2 from the frequent, severe population bottlenecks that occur in acute transmission chains, increasing the chances of generation and selection of new variants with mutations that alter antigenicity, transmissibility, or pathogenic potential.
